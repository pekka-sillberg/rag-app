Project Setup and Deployment Instructions

This document contains step-by-step instructions to set up, install dependencies, and run the project.

---

1. Extract the Zip File
   - Unzip the project zip file to your desired directory.
   - Navigate to the root directory of the extracted project.

---

2. Install Dependencies
   This project has both backend and frontend dependencies.

   Install Both at Once:
   - Run the following command in the root directory:
     npm run install:all
   - This will:
     - Install backend dependencies.
     - Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install its dependencies.

   Install Manually (Optional):
   - Backend:
     - Run:
       npm install
   - Frontend:
     - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
       cd frontend
       npm install

---

3. Build and Deploy the Project

   Run the Deploy Command:
   - To build the frontend and run the backend server:
       npm run deploy
   - This will:
     - Build the production-ready frontend files (in `frontend/build`).
     - Start the backend server using `app.js`.

   Backend:
   - Runs on port `5000`, as specified in the `.env` file using the `PORT` variable.
   - Serves the `frontend/dist` folder as static files using Express.

   Run Frontend and Backend Separately (For Development):
   - Run the backend server:
       npm start
   - Run the frontend development server:
       cd frontend
       npm start
     - The frontend development server runs on port `3000` by default.

4. Access the Application

   - For the combined backend and frontend:
     - Access the application at http://localhost:5000.
   - For separate development environments:
     - Backend: Access the API via http://localhost:5000.
     - Frontend: Access the UI via http://localhost:3000.

5. Notes
   - Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
     Verify with:
       node -v
       npm -v
   - If a file or URL fails during processing, check the logs in:
     - `success-YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
     - `failed-YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
   - If the project relies on external APIs (like OpenAI), ensure the `.env` file contains the required API keys:
       OPEN_API_KEY=your-api-key
